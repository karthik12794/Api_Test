## Task Description

As part of my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS, I was assigned a task in the domain of Software Testing, specifically to perform API testing using Postman. The main goal of this task was to gain hands-on experience in testing web APIs, understanding how requests interact with server endpoints, and validating the responses for correctness and reliability. API testing is a crucial aspect of modern software quality assurance, as it ensures that backend services work properly, communicate effectively with the frontend, and maintain data integrity across systems. This task also aimed to help me learn professional documentation practices, creating submission-ready artifacts for review.

The task involved working with two endpoints from the DummyJSON API, a public API designed for learning and testing purposes. The first endpoint was a POST request to simulate a user login. I had to send a JSON payload containing a username and password and verify that the API responded with a status of 201 Created. The second endpoint was a GET request to fetch a list of users, where I validated that the response returned a 200 OK status along with accurate user data. This exercise helped me understand how to validate API responses, including status codes, response time, and JSON data structure, which is essential in professional software testing.

Attention to detail was critical, as even small mistakes like extra spaces in the URL or using the wrong HTTP method could result in errors such as 404 Not Found. I carefully validated the URLs, request methods, and payloads before sending requests. I also learned to handle potential errors and exceptions in API testing, which is a crucial skill for a QA professional.

Another key part of the task was documentation and organization. I captured screenshots of the successful API responses, named them properly, and organized them in a structured folder. I exported the Postman collection in v2.1 format to ensure it could be easily shared or imported. This helped me practice professional workflow standards, similar to what is expected in real-world QA tasks. By completing this task, I developed confidence in API testing, documentation, and presenting results in a clear and professional manner.

## How I Prepared

Before starting the API testing, I installed and configured Postman. I studied the DummyJSON API documentation to understand the endpoints, required HTTP methods, request payloads, and expected responses. I also practiced sending POST and GET requests in Postman to become familiar with setting headers, validating responses, and capturing screenshots.

I prepared a clear folder structure for submission and decided on proper naming conventions for screenshots and exported JSON files. I also reviewed common API testing practices to ensure that I followed professional standards for sending requests, checking responses, and organizing results.

## What I Have Done

Created the Postman Collection (CODTECH_API_Testing):

Added two requests:

User Login (POST) → URL: https://dummyjson.com/users/add

Fetch Users (GET) → URL: https://dummyjson.com/users

Named the requests according to the internship instructions.

Exported the collection in v2.1 format.

Executed POST Request (User Login):

Sent JSON payload with username and password.

Verified status 201 Created in the response.

Captured screenshot and saved as POST_UserLogin.png.

Executed GET Request (Fetch Users):

Verified that the API returned 200 OK and correct JSON array of users.

Captured screenshot and saved as GET_FetchUsers.png.

Organized Folder Structure:

Created folder: CODTECH_API_Testing_Submission.

Saved Postman collection, screenshots, and README in the folder.

Documented Everything Professionally
